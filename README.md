# Echocity
EchoCity is a decentralized soundscape — a world where users can leave their voices across a digital map. Each sound is stored on IPFS, and its coordinates plus metadata are registered on-chain. The web app lets you connect your EVM wallet, sign in with Google, upload short audio clips, and explore echoes left by others.
