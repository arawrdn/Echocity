# EchoCity

**Leave your voice on the decentralized map of echoes.**

EchoCity is an experimental Web3 soundscape where users can upload and explore sound fragments across a decentralized world map.  
Each sound is pinned to a location and permanently recorded on-chain as a unique echo of its creator.

## Features
- Connect EVM wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Google Sign-In for user identity
- Upload and pin sounds to a digital map
- Store audio on IPFS, metadata on smart contract
- Explore global “echoes” in a 2D map interface

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Audio: HTML5 Audio API
- Map: Leaflet.js
- IPFS: Web3.Storage SDK
- Smart Contract: Solidity
- Network: Base
- Auth: Firebase Google Sign-In
